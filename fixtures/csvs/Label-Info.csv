BEPI,Business Environmental Performance Initiative (BEPI),"The Business Environmental Performance Initiative (BEPI) is a business –driven initiative, providing companies with a practical framework that helps to manage and improve environmental sustainability in the supply chain. The BEPI framework is built on the GSCP Environmental Reference Tools and aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). By joining BEPI, a company becomes a member of the initiative’s umbrella organisation, the Foreign Trade Association (FTA), which founded BEPI in 2014 and the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) in 2003. BEPI is not a certification body or scheme. It is a system that supports companies to continuously improve environmental performance in their supply chain through practical support. In 2016, BEPI had 119 members.","Supporting scheme for companies to improve environmental performane, no certification",,,,0,2,0,1,"Environmental Management System (EMS) is mandatory and at the core of the standard.

ETI,Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI),"The ETI emerged as a response to campaigns from civil society in the 1990s, which exposed exploitation in the production of consumer goods. It is a multi-stakeholder initiative consisting of companies, trade unions and NGOs. The ETI describes a base code derived from ILO conventions. Member companies need to work towards full compliance of the code. It does not certify products or factories but evaluates a random selection of 20% of annual reports. These are reviewed by the ETI board, which evaluates where progress has been made and where further action is required. If member companies do not make sufficient progress, or fail to honor their membership obligations, ETI can terminate their membership. Currently there are 67 full members. ","The ETI Base Code is applicable to all consumer goods. Moreover, it is increasingly applied to goods not for resale, like construction materials and logistics operations. ETI is also collaborating with government departments on procurement policy, e.g. in the UK.",,,,4,5,no evaluation*,1,no evaluation*,,,4,5,1,,green/yellow,no evaluation*,green/yellow
GLOBALG.A.P,GLOBALG.A.P. / GRASP,"GLOBALG.A.P. is a private sector initiative that sets voluntary standards for certification of production processes of agriculture products around the world.

Its holistic approach, the Integrated Farm Assessment (IFA) includes food safety and traceability, biodiversity, animal welfare, and quality management. GLOBALG.A.P. Certification is available for three scopes of production (crops, livestock and acquaculture), consisting of a total of 16 standards. In addition to IFA, the GLOBALG.A.P. Risk Assessment on Social Practices (GRASP) is a voluntary ready-to-use module designed to assess social practices on the farm. Currently, more than 160,000 producers in 120 countries are certified.","Certification covers the process from farm inputs like plant propagation, feed or seedlings and all the farming activities until the products leaves the farm.

GSCP,Global Social Compliance Program (GSCP),"The Global Social Compliance Programme (GSCP) is a corporate-driven programme to promote social and environmental sustainability along global supply chains of retail companies, brand manufacturers, and others.

GSCP is part of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), which is a corporate association that exists since 1953. The CGF is governed by a Board of Directors comprised of 50 CEOs from retailers and manufacturers. Currently, about 400 retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and other stakeholders across 70 countries are members of the CGF. Civil society is consulted through NGO and University representatives in the advisory board of GSCP. GSCP does not verify or certify products or companies. Instead, it offers a suite of voluntary best practice Reference tools that can be used as best practice guidance. Companies, voluntary sustainability standards, auditing bodies or multi-stakeholder initiatives may use the Equivalence Programme (EP) to benchmark their Code of Conduct or standard in terms of social and environmental reference requirements, audit process and methodology.

GRI,GRI - Global Reporting Initiative,"GRI is an international, non-profit organization that is specialized in corporate sustainability reporting since 1997. Its history goes back to the early 1990s, when the Coalition for Environmentally Reponsible Economies (CERES) developed a framework for environmental reporting. GRI aims at integrating sustainability management (e.g. on climate change, human rights, corruption, etc.) in every organization’s decision making process. It is currently the most widely used standard on sustainability reporting worldwide. At present, 42 countries and regions reference GRI in their policies. GRI is built upon a multi-stakeholder principle, which ensures the participation and expertise of diverse stakeholders in the development of its standards. The Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB) is GRI’s independent standard-setting body. In 2016, the GSSB restructured the GRI G4 Guidelines into a set of modular interrelated GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards).
